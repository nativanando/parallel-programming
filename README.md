## Implementing methods using MPI and its collection API for Cluster Environments

Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a de-facto standard to provide HPC environment in clusters connected over fast interconnect and gigabit LAN. MPI standard itself is architecture neutral and programming language independent.

In this project we will find some examples of implementations in MPI for cluster of computers and high performance computing.
